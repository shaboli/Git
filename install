1. create the ssh key - it will be created in .ssh dir in 'user'.
   the directory is hidden so run:
   "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true" 
   "killall Finder"

2.  keys name need to be id_rsa
    Finding what keys ssh is offering to the server is fairly simple. 
	Run "ssh -vT git@github.com"
3.  test connection using "ssh -T git@github.com" and with the password you enter in the ssh key "ykm_dev"

msysgit - windows

--general git config

DELETE
If you delete a file which is under version control git add . will not pick this file up. 
You need to use the git commit command with the -a flag or the -A flag in the git add command.
# Try standard way of committing -> will not work 
git add . && git commit -m "a new file has been created"
# Now commit with the -a flag
git commit -a -m "File nonsense.txt is now removed"
# Alternatively you could add deleted files to the staging index via
git add -A . 
git commit -m "File nonsense.txt is now removed"
